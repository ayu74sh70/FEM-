However, due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPython, multithreading doesn't achieve true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks (tasks that heavily use the CPU).\n",

It divides objects into generations based on their age and periodically runs a tracing algorithm to identify and collect unreachable objects involved in cycles. Newer objects are in younger generations and are checked more frequently than older objects."

        "**Answer:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Multithreading is important in certain applications, particularly those that are I/O-bound, because it allows the program to remain responsive and productive while waiting for external operations to complete. Here's why:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Responsiveness:** In applications with user interfaces, multithreading can prevent the UI from freezing while the program is performing a long-running task (like downloading data or reading a large file). A separate thread can handle the task, allowing the main thread to continue responding to user interactions.\n",
        "*   **Improved Throughput (for I/O-bound tasks):** When a thread is waiting for an I/O operation to finish, the Python interpreter can switch to another thread that is ready to execute. This allows the program to make progress on other tasks instead of being idle.\n",
        "*   **Simplified Design for Concurrent Tasks:** For tasks that naturally involve waiting (like network communication or database operations), using threads can simplify the program's design compared to using a single-threaded approach with complex asynchronous programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, it's important to remember that due to the GIL, multithreading is generally not suitable for CPU-bound tasks that require true parallelism on multiple cores. For such tasks, multiprocessing is a better choice."
